# DevOpsDays and Conference Resource

Welcome to the DevOpsDays Resource Repo. The intent of this repository is to try and capture the knowledge and practice built up over the decade of DevOpsDays conferences happening world wide. Many of us run into the same problems, and are all learning from scratch. Let's leverage our community to put on the best events possible regardless of how experienced we are individually.

## Using This Resource

This is an emerging resource and I'm not quite sure what it's going to look like yet. The intention is to capture our collective knowledge and practices in an easily referenced location. In an ideal world you should be able to navigate the knowledge base from the GitHub repo or attendant website cobbled together out of piles of markdown, but I didn't want to use exclusively a web-page/wiki. I want to be able to include code snippets as they become relevant (see the Twilio folder). Maybe there's a hybrid case here for something more navigable and pretty and some code storage.

For now, feel free to submit PRs to update with your practices, runbooks, handy code, etc. in clearly marked files and in subfolders as it might make sense. A Contribution document will be drafted as a good organizational structure emerges.  


## Minimally Viable DevOpsDays
(The idea here is to capture, what do I need to do in order to execute a DevOpsDays Conference. If a document doesn't exist, please feel free to contribute. We're working on it. In our free time, as ever.)
