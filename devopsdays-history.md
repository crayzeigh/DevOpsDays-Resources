# DevOpsDays: A History

As important as it is to think of the future of software composition and delivery, it is important to know where we came from. Appropriately, it all started with Open Spaces...

At Agile.. <blah blah, background story update later>

Beginning in 2009 in Ghent, Belgium, DevOpsDays events were always meant to be a little different from the average tech conference. They are community organized by volunteers and make no profit year over year. All money is either used or reinvested in local communities. Each year it seems like someone new is starting their DevOpsDays experience, but for some of us, we've been practicing this for years and have MANY OPINIONS about talk selections, Open Spaces, T-Shirts and name badges. So rather than feel like we're doing the same work over and over, here are our collective practices, experiences and opinions on how to make the most of your DevOpsDays.
