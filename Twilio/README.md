# Using Twilio Functions

To use the functions in this folder you'll have to have setup a Twilio account and have already purchased a number that supports SMS and Voice at least.

1. Login to your twilio account and navigate to Functions
1. Create a new function and select the "Blank" template
1. Replace any code in that function with the code from one of the files here.
1. Edit or create any necessary environment variables
1. Under your Twilio number, assign incoming voice or messages to the appropriate function.

This should get update later with specific steps for the functions in question, but this serves as a placeholder for now.

Happy Calling.
